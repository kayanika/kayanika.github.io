    "Hello, good people! I am Anika Monir. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at IQVIA. I work in the ETL squad of Data service team.

    "My biggest strength is that I can find easy solutions in complicated situations. For example, once in our second year of university, we had to do a datbase project mimicing a car warehouse system.I made the system real time  with only the knowledge of threads I had just learned in my database course. To this day, this feat gives me confidence that I can solve any problem if I put my mind to it.",

    "My research Interest lies in HCI. I know it sounds cliche but I really want to make a difference in the world- HCI seems like the perfect field for me to do that. Please contact me if you have any research proposal or project that I can be a part of!."
